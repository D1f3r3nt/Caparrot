a cultural question about the town and to find the other caparrots you get clues as you walk.

2. All folders will have a barrel file and in case you want to import any element of the folder you have to import the barrel file, for example, in case you want to import the home page, you will have to import the "pages.dart" file.

3. The name of the files and classes will also be in English, but the file name will use the underscore typology, e.g. "home_page.dart" and this same class must be called the same but with Camel typology (the first capital letter), e.g. "HomePage".
